# memwiper
Memory-wiping utilities for Linux and BSD systems.

Three utilities enabling you to wipe a file, your ram, or the entire free space of a device. 
It all began when I wanted to see whether I could write a simple yet effective piece of code that would overwrite RAM with random data.
I regard it as my own "Hello world" project for system programming.
